# Requirements

Tested with Foundation 5.2 and Coda 2.0 - 2.5.

# Installation

Install the plugin as you would any Coda plugin: Download and double-click. Highlight any text and, depending on the function, each component will generate the necessary HTML. Items with links will recognize Markdown in your selection. Selecting no text will usually generate a sample similar to [the docs](http://foundation.zurb.com).
